## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

My notes about the project :

1- I added the 4th section to the index HTML file as required, just by copying the same previous html code of (section 3)/then edit all the data to section 4 rather than 3.

2- I added the script tag at the end of the code after the footer closed tag and make the source app.js file.

3- started working in the app.js file

4-  Try to  follow the tips that was in that presentation:
